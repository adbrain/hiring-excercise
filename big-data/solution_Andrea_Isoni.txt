I used the repository daily_maxt.txt, daily_mint.txt and temp-inventory.txt from the National Climate Data Center 
to generate a MongoDB database with the following columns: latitude, longitude, date, tmax,tmin. 
I compared  that data, which are averaged over 30 years (1980-2010), with the 2013 data for the first quarter 
(January-March) at the station USC00210018 (latitude=47.2992,longitude=-965161'). The resulting figure of (Tmax+Tmin)/2
shows that the temperature are higher with respect to the mean on the previous 30 years. 
The climate change trend in this particular case shows an increase of the temperature (see figure below).
